<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Manuel Coding and I am a 24 year old IT systems specialist and i have worked in the IT industry for 24 years.  
  I am currently learning many new skills including the entire Front End stack in Web Development.
  I have been in my current role now for 2 years implementing and integrating new IT systems around the world
  for some very high end clients who supply ID documentation to their peoples.  This includes installing Network 
  Solutions as well as Hardware to enable our solution to sit on both Physical and Virtual systems. The systems predominantly
  use Windows tech stack including Windows Server OS, SQL, Hyper-V and alongside that we implement physical SAN storage
  so that we can have some kind of resilience as well as storage for data.  We also utilize VEEAM as our primary backup solution
  in the event that the system suffers any kind of data loss or worse some kind of catastrophic event.  
  The Networking stack that we tend to use are either fortinet or Cisco devices which are robust and prove to be good choices for our systems.
  We also install and CAT test personalization devices like the IAI BM PRO or IAI's flagship device the BM One. 
All of this is required so that we can install our proprietary software solution for our customers.</p>

<p>In my spare time I have several hobbies which include playing golf which I have now been playing for 34 years, and fishing which  I have
  been doing as a pastime since I was in my teens. As part of my hobbies I also like to travel around the world when possible
  to test my skills in foreign lands.</p>

<p>I also get great pleasure in traveling the world when we can with my partner who is also a keen traveler and we love nothing more
  than to experience different cultures especially their food and drink along with the fine weather of course.</p>
